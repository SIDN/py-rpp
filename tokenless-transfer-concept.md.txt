# Abstract

This document proposes a secure, tokenless alternative to the traditional
authInfo-based domain transfer model used in EPP (Extensible Provisioning
Protocol). It introduces a new domain status flag, "freeForTransfer," which the
current sponsoring registrar sets to explicitly authorize a domain transfer to
a specific gaining registrar, scoped by expiration time.

This mechanism addresses longstanding problems with authInfo, including
phishing, weak entropy, shared secret misuse, and poor user experience.

# 1 Introduction

The Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) currently uses an "authInfo"
shared secret to authorize domain transfers. This method suffers from
significant drawbacks including vulnerability to phishing, poor user
experience, and the need for registrants to manage sensitive secrets.

This document introduces a new domain status flag, "freeForTransfer,"
designed for modern, tokenless transfer authorization within a JSON-based
Registry Provisioning Protocol (RPP) environment. The flag explicitly
authorizes transfer to a specified gaining registrar for a limited time.

# 2 Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

# 3 The freeForTransfer Status

## 3.1 Definition

The "freeForTransfer" status is a domain metadata object indicating that the
current sponsoring registrar has authorized the transfer of the domain to a
specified gaining registrar without requiring the traditional authInfo shared
secret.

## 3.2 JSON Representation

The status is represented as a JSON object with the following fields:

~~~
{
  "freeForTransfer": {
    "enabled": true,
    "registrar": "r-gaining-xyz",
    "expiresAt": "2025-07-20T12:00:00Z"
  }
}
~~~

## 3.3 Field Descriptions

- **enabled** (boolean, REQUIRED): Indicates whether the status is active.

- **registrar** (string, REQUIRED): The identifier of the gaining registrar authorized to request transfer.

- **expiresAt** (date-time string, REQUIRED): The timestamp after which this authorization expires and the status is automatically revoked.

# 4 Domain Transfer Flow

## 4.1 Releasing the Domain

The losing registrar issues an update request to the registry, setting the
"freeForTransfer" status for the domain:

~~~
PATCH /domains/example.com

{
  "freeForTransfer": {
    "enabled": true,
    "registrar": "r-gaining-xyz",
    "expiresAt": "2025-07-20T12:00:00Z"
  }
}
~~~

Only the sponsoring registrar may perform this update.

## 4.2 Initiating Transfer

The gaining registrar submits a transfer request:

~~~
POST /transfers

{
  "domain": "example.com",
  "gainingRegistrar": "r-gaining-xyz"
}
~~~

The registry validates that:

- The freeForTransfer status is enabled.

- The gainingRegistrar matches the registrar in the status.

- The current time is before expiresAt.

If validation succeeds, the transfer proceeds per registry policy.

# 5 Security Considerations

## 5.1 Integrity and Confidentiality

All RPP requests and responses MUST be cryptographically signed and
authenticated using mechanisms such as HTTP Signatures or JWTs to prevent
tampering and spoofing.

The freeForTransfer status MUST NOT be exposed via unauthenticated WHOIS or
RDAP queries.

## 5.2 Abuse Mitigation

Registries MUST implement rate limiting on transfer requests and monitor for
abuse patterns.

Expired freeForTransfer statuses MUST be revoked automatically.

All changes to freeForTransfer status and related transfers MUST be logged for
audit purposes.

# 6 Registry Requirements

Registries MUST:

- Enforce that transfer requests using freeForTransfer have matching registrar.

- Reject transfer requests with mismatched or missing authorization with HTTP
  403 Forbidden.

- Remove expired freeForTransfer statuses automatically.

- Allow losing registrars to revoke freeForTransfer by disabling the status.

# 7 Transition and Coexistence

Registries MAY support both traditional authInfo and freeForTransfer-based
transfers.

Transfer requests MUST use either the authInfo or the freeForTransfer status,
but NOT both.

Registries MAY reject authInfo transfers if freeForTransfer is active for the
domain.

# 8 Future Extensions

Potential future extensions include:

- multiUse (boolean): Allow multiple transfers within the expiry window.

- notifyRegistrant (boolean): Trigger notification emails to the registrant
  when the freeForTransfer status is set.

- comment (string): A field for audit or transfer rationale.

# 9 IANA Considerations

This document requests the registration of the "freeForTransfer" domain status
under the EPP domain status registry.
